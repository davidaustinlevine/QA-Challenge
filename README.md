Simple functional  Playwright tests written in Python (with pytest) 

# Requirements:

      Python 3.7 or above 
      nodeJS v11 or higher
      Playwright 1.18 or higher 
      Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

# Pre-Installation:

  pip installer
  
      pip install --upgrade pip
  
  Node.js --
   
   macOS
   
    brew install node

   Android 
   
    pkg install nodejs

   Windows
   
    Download installer directly from the node.js web site
     
   or Using Winget:
   
     winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
     
    # or for LTS
    
     winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

   or Using Chocolatey:
   
     cinst nodejs
     
    # or for full install with npm
    
     cinst nodejs.install

# Install Playwright --
   Python
    
    pip install pytest-playwright
    

   nodeJS
    
    npm i -D @playwright/test
    
   install supported browsers (Node)
   
    npx playwright install

# Usage: 
Once installed, you can import Playwright in a Python script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (chromium, firefox and webkit):

    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("http://playwright.dev")
        print(page.title())
        browser.close()

# Running: Run all tests in the suite

   macOS (pytest CLI)
   
    pytest
 
   Windows
   
    npx playwright { directory }
